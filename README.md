# Surf Shop Analysis
## Overview of the Surf Shop Analysis
Starting a Surf Shop in Hawaii can be risky without carefully looking at weather data. With rain playing a major factor in whether people will want to go out, surf, and come back to shore for some ice cream and board wax, determining weather patterns is key to opening a successful Surf Shop. 
## Surf Shop Analysis Results
Using weather data over a 6 year period from 2010 to 2016 can help determine the months with the highest temperatures, lowest temperatures, and the months with the most and least precipitation. For this challenge we were asked only to look at temperatures.

## Summary of the Surf Shop Analysis
Some recommendations I would make for this analysis would be to include more than just temperatures in the weather data. After all W. Avy started a surf shop, but it failed due to rain. Including rain in the weather anaysis would help.
