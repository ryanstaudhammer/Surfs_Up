# Surf Shop Analysis
## Overview of the Surf Shop Analysis
Starting a Surf Shop in Hawaii can be risky without carefully looking at weather data. With rain playing a major factor in whether people will want to go out, surf, and come back to shore for some ice cream and board wax, determining weather patterns is key to opening a successful Surf Shop.
